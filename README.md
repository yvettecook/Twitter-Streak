## Twitter Streak

Inspired by the GitHub stats graph, this tool will allow you to see any user's year in tweets.

### Tools

Built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node). Possible without to 'M' as the app at this stage doesn't look like it will need a DB component

### Current Status

*Technology*

* Getting more familiar with stack by doing the new Angular tutorial from the Makers Academy course.
* Setting up initial node environment with testing

*Development*

* Starting user stories
