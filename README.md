## Twitter Streak

Inspired by the GitHub stats graph, this tool will allow you to see any user's year in tweets.

### Tools

Built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node)

### Getting Started

User stories:

1) As a curious user / I land on the homepage / And enter a username into the box

2) With a username entered / The user clickes search / And a stats graph appears
